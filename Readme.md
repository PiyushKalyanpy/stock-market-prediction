# 📈 Stock Market Prediction and News Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict stock market trends and visualize the results on a web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time data:** The system fetches real-time data from Yahoo Finance and integrates it with pre-collected historical data to make predictions.
- **Multiple prediction models:** Currently the project uses Linear Regression but we can use the other models too for more accuracy, including  LSTM, and Random Forest.
- **Web interface:** The results are displayed in an interactive web interface with easy-to-understand visualizations and charts.
- **News Sentiment:** The web interface shows the sentiment analysis, that shows the increase and decrease of stock price on the basis of news.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

The following technologies were used in this project:

- **Python:** The project was written in Python, using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn and Flask.
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** The web interface was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with framework such as Tailwind css.

## 🤖 Models Used

The following machine learning models were used for stock market prediction:

- **Linear Regression:** A simple model that uses linear regression to predict stock prices based on historical data. (currently using this model)
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** A deep learning model that uses LSTM layers to capture the temporal dependencies in the data and make accurate predictions. (not used in this project)
- **Random Forest:** A decision tree-based ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.(not used in this project)

## 📚 Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3 and the required libraries installed. You can then clone the repository and run the `app.py` file to start the server. And then run `index.html` for running the web interface.
